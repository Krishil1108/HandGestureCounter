# HandGestureCounter
A computer vision project that uses a webcam to detect and count the number of fingers shown in real-time. HandGestureCounter leverages deep learning and image processing techniques to recognize various finger gestures, enabling intuitive interactions with the computer through simple hand movements.

Features:

•  Real-Time Detection: Instantly detect and count fingers with minimal latency.
•  User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface that displays the count on-screen as fingers are detected.
•  Versatile Applications: Can be used in various applications like gesture-based control, interactive presentations, and virtual games.
•  Flexible Setup: Works with most webcams and can be run on various devices, including laptops and desktops.

Technologies Used:

•  OpenCV for real-time video processing
•  TensorFlow/PyTorch for model implementation (optional for more complex hand gesture recognition)
•  Python as the primary programming language

Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the main script to start detecting fingers with your webcam.
